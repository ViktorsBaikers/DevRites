## Codex compatibility

This is the Codex mirror of a DevRites skill. In Codex:

- Load DevRites engineering standards from `.agents/skills/devrites-lib/reference/standards/`. Read `.agents/skills/devrites-lib/reference/standards/core.md` before workflow work, then load the other `.agents/skills/devrites-lib/reference/standards/*.md` files exactly when this skill asks for them.
- Use the installed `devrites-engine` binary as the canonical runtime helper surface for orientation, gates, and state mutation.
- **Invocation and dispatch are different:** invoke means run a skill in this context; dispatch means start a fresh agent with `spawn_agent`, await it, and reconcile its result. Never describe inline skill work as a dispatch.
- Inspect the current `spawn_agent` role list. When the named `devrites-<role>` is exposed, dispatch it with `fork_turns="none"`; full-history forks inherit the parent type. The matching project contract is `.codex/agents/devrites-<role>.toml`.
- If a named role is not exposed, use generic `explorer` for every read-only role with `fork_turns="none"`. Tell it to read `.codex/agents/devrites-<role>.toml`, follow its `developer_instructions`, and execute the unchanged packet. Trusted `.codex/hooks.json` binds `agent_type=explorer` to the fail-closed reviewer read-only guard.
- For `devrites-slice-wright`, trusted `.codex/hooks.json` binds generic `worker` (`agent_type=worker`) to the active reconcile window and exact `.wright-allowlist`. Dispatch that worker with `fork_turns="none"`, tell it to read `.codex/agents/devrites-slice-wright.toml`, and execute the unchanged packet. Never create `.reconcile-inline` when this safe rung is available.
- A missing custom role is not evidence that spawning is unavailable. Only when the project hooks are unavailable or untrusted, no spawn primitive exists, or higher-priority policy rejects a safe spawn may the root run the documented discipline inline. Label it `independence: fallback`, never call it independent, create `.reconcile-inline` only for that path, and apply every fallback risk gate.
- Wait for every required fresh-context dispatch before reconciling or advancing. A backgrounded or lost result is incomplete.
- Codex project hooks are installed in `.codex/hooks.json`; declared-leaf hooks are scoped inside `.codex/agents/devrites-*.toml`. Review and trust them with `/hooks` before relying on hook enforcement.
- When this skill asks a HITL question via `AskUserQuestion`: Codex's equivalent (`request_user_input`) exists only in Plan mode. Outside Plan mode, render the option set as a plain numbered list in chat and **end the turn** so the human answers: NEVER silently pick an option yourself; auto-picking is AFK's contract, gated by the `.devrites/AFK` sentinel.


# devrites-audit: read-only audit dispatch

Dispatch one fresh-context, read-only review axis for the active feature. The caller
decides how to use the report; this skill never edits.

## Axis

| Argument | Role | Discipline |
|---|---|---|
| `security` | `devrites-security-auditor` | trust boundaries, OWASP, secrets, dependencies |
| `perf` | `devrites-performance-reviewer` | measure-first hot paths, N+1, payload/bundle and stated budgets |
| `simplify` | `devrites-simplifier-reviewer` | behavior-preserving deletion/simplification; Suggestion/Nit/FYI only |

If no axis is supplied, infer only when intent is unambiguous; otherwise the root asks
the human before dispatch.

## Gather and dispatch

1. Resolve `.devrites/ACTIVE`; require `spec.md` and `touched-files.md`.
2. Follow the universal file-backed packet, result, budget, retry, and fresh-context
   dispatch ladder in
   [`agents.md`](../devrites-lib/reference/standards/agents.md).
3. Set `payload.type: review-findings`; include `spec.md`, `decisions.md` when present,
   `evidence.md` for performance, `touched-files.md`, and the immutable diff.
4. Objective: derive expected behavior independently, apply the role's documented
   discipline, and return one labeled finding per line with `file:line`.
5. Await, validate, and pass the role payload to the caller verbatim. The root
   reconciles and decides what to accept.

Use one dispatch per axis. If several axes are requested, use separate packets with
no cross-pollination and the shared maximum of three concurrent read-only roles.

## Fallback and scope

Use the capability ladder; inline is allowed only when no safe fresh-context rung
preserves the role's read-only boundary or policy rejects it, and must say
`independence: fallback`. Use these role contracts:

- `.codex/agents/devrites-security-auditor.toml`
- `.codex/agents/devrites-performance-reviewer.toml`
- `.codex/agents/devrites-simplifier-reviewer.toml`

Seal weights that fallback under
[`risk-and-rollback.md`](../rite-seal/reference/risk-and-rollback.md). Stay inside the
active feature. Critical findings block seal; simplification never changes behavior.
