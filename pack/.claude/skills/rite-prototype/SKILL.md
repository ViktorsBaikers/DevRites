# /rite-prototype: answer one question with throwaway code

A prototype is throwaway code for exactly one question. Choose its shape from that
question.

## 0. Read core rules

Read `.claude/skills/devrites-lib/reference/standards/core.md` first: the operating rules and the Persistence-before-stopping
discipline apply even to throwaway code. The other rule files load on demand.

## 1. Name the question

If the user did not give the question explicitly, ask **one** short question to pin it
down. Examples that count as "the question":

- "Does this reducer correctly model add / undo / re-add of the same item?"
- "Which of these three settings layouts feels right?"
- "Will the proposed state machine deadlock when X overlaps Y?"

A vague request such as "explore this feature" is not enough. Ask once for a specific
question.

## 2. Pick the branch

Read the user's prompt and surrounding code, then choose one branch:

| Question shape | Branch | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| "Does this **logic / state / data model** behave right?" | **Logic** | Smallest runnable harness (terminal script / REPL / mini node or python file) that pushes the model through the hard cases. |
| "What should this **look like / which UX wins**?" | **UI** | 2-4 **radically different** UI variations on a single route, switchable via a query param + a small floating selector bar. |

If genuinely ambiguous and the user is AFK: pick by the surrounding code (backend module
→ Logic; page / component → UI) and state the assumption in a comment at the top.

**Variations must differ in structure.** Colour or padding changes alone do not answer
a design question. Give each variation a different information architecture or
interaction model.

## 3. Rules that apply to both branches

1. **Mark it as throwaway.** Place the prototype near its eventual use, but use a name
   that clearly identifies it: `prototype/`, `__prototype__`, `.scratch/`, etc. Obey the project's
   existing routing / module convention; don't invent a new top-level structure.
2. **Provide one run command.** Use the project's existing task runner: `pnpm
   <name>`, `python <path>`, or `bun <path>`.
3. **No persistence by default.** State lives in memory. Persistence is usually the
   thing the prototype is *checking*, not a dependency. If the question explicitly
   involves a DB, hit a scratch DB or a local file with a name like
   `PROTOTYPE — wipe me`.
4. **Skip polish.** Add no tests, abstractions, or error handling beyond what is needed
   to run and answer the question.
5. **Surface state.** After every action (Logic) or on every variant switch (UI), print
   or render the full relevant state so the user can see what changed.
6. **Delete or absorb when done.** After answering the question, delete the prototype
   or fold the validated decision into production code.

## 4. Capture the answer

The answer is the only durable output. Before declaring the prototype done, write
one of:

- An entry in the active feature's `decisions.md` (`.devrites/work/<slug>/decisions.md`)
  with the question and the answer.
- A `NOTES.md` next to the prototype if no active feature exists.

If the user is present, ask for the verdict directly. In AFK, the prototype remains
incomplete until the verdict is filled in. A blank `VERDICT: ___` is not an answer.
Mark it **not yet complete**. Queue the question and do not delete the prototype until
a later pass records the verdict.

## Where this slots in

`/rite-prototype` is a scoped detour, not a separate phase. Typical uses:

- **During `/rite-clarify` (between spec and define):** a product/constraint question is
  undecidable on paper; prototype it, capture the answer, return to `/rite-clarify`.
- **Mid-build:** `/rite-build` hit a state-model ambiguity that the spec doesn't
  resolve. Drop into a Logic prototype, capture the answer, return.

After the prototype answers the question and the answer is recorded, return to the
calling phase. The prototype itself does **not** ship.

## Output

```
Done: prototype answered <question>.
Changed: <prototype path | deleted after absorption>; decisions.md or NOTES.md
Evidence: run command <cmd -> result>; verdict <one line>
Open: <none | non-blocking delete/absorb follow-up>
Next: <single command returning to the calling phase>
Record: <.devrites/work/<slug>/decisions.md | NOTES.md path>
↻ Hygiene: /clear after the answer is recorded; delete or absorb throwaway code before shipping
```

If the verdict is missing, use the shared `Awaiting human` form. The prototype is
not `Done`, and `Resume:` points to the queued verdict question.
